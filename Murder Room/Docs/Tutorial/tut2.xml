<posting title="Forensic Analyzer">The Forensic Analyzer is Nova's advanced forensics system, capable of scanning almost every object and file an operative comes across in their investigation.
The Forensic Analyzer is used to gleam new data from evidence scans and files uploaded. The information the analyzer can determine includes, but is not limited to:
    - Fingerprints
    - DNA
    - IPs
    - Facial profiles

When uploading a non-evidence file to the Forensic Analyzer, it is also capable of locating and appending to the netmap source IPs, as well as user accounts for those source IPs. For example, uploading an email to the analyzer
will analyze its header and display the source IP on the netmap.
