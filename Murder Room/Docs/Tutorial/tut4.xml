<posting title="Hacking">During an investigation, an operative may be forced to hack into a node they are otherwise unable to access.
Port cracking tools are provided to the operative, and running the tools on a node with the target port number will open the ports and allow
an operative to penetrate the computer using the PortHack command. However, it is important to note that not all ports have available port crackers.
