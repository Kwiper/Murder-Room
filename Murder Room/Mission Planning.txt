Greetings, dataminer!
What you see here is the planning document I created for this extension that I referred to all the way throughout development.
Some aspects were changed in the final version, but not drastically enough that it diverged from the plan.
I considered deleting this before uploading, but I figured since I put the time and effort into it, it should stay as legacy content.
So, enjoy my thought dump of stuff.
- Kwiper


Chapter 1 - Startup

    - There is a three day gap between the last two logins - One locally, accessed January 9th, and one acessed remotely, January 12th.
        - After uploading this, G speculates that Staleski was killed sometime during or after the 9th, and whoever killed him tried to access his laptop for some reason, but wasn't able to until the 12th.
        - Whoever did hack into Staleski's laptop managed to cover their tracks well.

- After discovering more concrete date of death:
    - G messages the player saying there doesn't look to be anything else on Staleski's laptop. But the player is now one step closer to the true culprit.
    - G mentions to the player another feature of the Forensic Analyzer - the ability to find IPs of email sites from email addresses.

- After uploading emails
    - Player gains access to DLabs' mail server. They can read Staleski's mail, but they don't reveal much outside of his absence.
    - Player is also able to access their jmail. Jmail can't be hacked. Player sees emails about a recent transaction.

- From here, the investigation is more open-ended. The player will still do both eventually, but in which order is up to the player.

Hilda Email
    - Hilda tells the player that despite all this, the player doesn't yet know who the real killer is. She tells the player that photographic evidence was left at
    the scene of the crime showing the face of the true murderer. She tells the player that evidence has been uploaded to the Case File. The final piece of evidence.

Case File
    - A single image is shown. A man in a hospital bed with another man overlooking him. However, this image face is distorted. Some kind of interference.
    - After uploading the file to the forensic analyzer, the identity cannot be confirmed. Hilda suspects whoever tampered with this left a trail.







IRC Chat
    - G feigns surprise. Hacknet? Nova was keeping such a dark secret?


Graves:
    Hello, agent. It's good to finally meet you.
G:
    That voice... it can't be
Graves:
    My name is Maurice Graves. As I understand it, you believe I am involved in the murder of the director of Nova.
G:
    Don't do it, Graves.
Graves:
    I don't think you're in a position to tell me what to do, especially after you tried framing me, G.
    Or should I say
    Gideon Mahler.
Mahler:
    ...
Mail from Hilda:
    At last, the truth has been revealed.
Graves:
    I was willing to support you in your cause. But I don't much appreciate being used as a scapegoat for your own crimes.
    I especially don't appreciate being framed for the murder of the director.
Mahler:
    You don't understand. This was for the sake of exposing Nova.
Hilda:
    Don't you dare listen to him.
Graves:
    Is this why you gave the agent all the cases that would eventually lead him to this truth?
Mahler:
    It was for the good of this nation!
Hilda:
    He committed a crime and must be punished!
Graves:
    Listen to yourself. You're beginning to sound like the very institution you sought to destroy.
Mahler:
    #PLAYERNAME#, we can end this!
Hilda:
    Don't listen to him!
Mahler:
    We can expose Nova to the people!
Hilda:
    Think of how much we help the nation!
Graves:
    The choice is yours. Will you choose to be condemned for a crime you didn’t commit, running from society for a decision made by one you trusted? Or will you live to be a slave to the whims of a higher authority, all under the pretense of safety and security?
Mahler:
    BRING THEM DOWN! [Links to Nova's Core file system]
Hilda:
    HE MUST BE PUNSHED! [Links to Mahler's file system]

If the player chooses Mahler:
    Good choice. 
    We don't have much time.
    Nova will be trying to block us from entering its system, so we have to act quickly.
    I need you to break into Nova's central core, and download everything that will reveal the truth.
    Then, I need you to upload it all here.
    It's time.
    I'm counting on you.
    Get ready
    Set
    GO!

If the player chooses Hilda:
    Good, agent.
    We must act quickly now. I have a feeling Mahler will be trying everything he can to stop you, and stop us from preventing Nova from being exposed.
    Gideon Mahler must be destroyed completely. I've dispatched agents to converge on his location and apprahend him, but you must prevent him from
    damaging Nova any further.

    Break into his system. Destroy that son of a bitch.

If the player successfully uploads Hacknet and Nova files to Cytix drop server: [Freedom Ending]
    @#PLAYERNAME# good job!
    The files have been uploaded. It's time for Nova to be exposed to the world!
    They'll probably be coming after us now.
    I doubt Nova will be able to continue operating anymore
    Not if the people turn against them.
    I have faith they will.
    Either way, we'll have to lay low for a while.
    Cover your tracks.
    Leave nothing behind.
    I'm sorry it had to be this way, #PLAYERNAME#
    But it was for the good of the nation
    It was for the good of the world.
    This is where we part ways.
    Goodbye. 
    [Links to credits server.]

If the player deletes all the files on the Nova Core: [Fugitive Ending]
    @#PLAYERNAME# No no no what are you doing?!
    Gah!
    Damn, it doesn't matter anymore.
    We'll have to run now.
    Run as fast as we can. 
    Nova can rebuild and continue to operate within the shadows.
    But at least we dealt a severe blow to them.
    Listen, we shouldn't contact each other anymore for the time being.
    Not while Nova has us in their crosshairs.
    These are my last words to you, my friend.
    Run.
    [Links to credits server.]

If the player fails to complete the mission: [Prisoner of the State Ending]
    Mail from Hilda:
    It's too late for you now, #PLAYERNAME#.
    Gideon Mahler has been apprehended. We have your place surrounded.
    Make things easier on us and surrender.

    Good bye, traitor.
    [Links to credits server.]

If the player successfully defeats Gideon Mahler: [Safety and Security ending]
    Excellent work, agent.
    I've just received word that Mahler has been apprehended. We'll make sure that traitor gets the punishment he deserves.
    You've done a service to us, #PLAYERNAME#. Nova thanks you. This country thanks you.
    Get some rest, agent. You've earned it.
    I look forward to working with you in the future.

If the player fails to defeat Mahler: [Mutually Assured Destruction Ending]
    I trusted you.
    I thought I could get you to understand.
    Apparently not.
    I know there's no stopping Nova now.
    That's ok.
    I can at least deal one last blow to their credibility before it's over.
    I hope you rot in hell.

END OF MURDER ROOM.
