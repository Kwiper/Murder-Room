<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="8.0">Hi.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="11.0">This is strange.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="15.0">You're probably not used to communicating like this</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="19.5">But this was the only way I could get you to help without drawing the attention of Nova.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="22.0">I'll just get right to it.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="25.0">The director of Nova is dead.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="27.5">And Nova thinks I did it.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="31.0">But I swear to you, I did not kill him.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="34.0">And the fact that you didn't leave immediately suggests to me you're willing to help me for now.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="37.0">Look, I want to get to the bottom of this.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="40.0">If you're willing to help me, then I will be forever indebted to you.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="43.0">Anyways. The director's name was George Yularen.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="47.5">Prior to his death, he was recovering from a heart operation and was on a pacemaker life support system to keep him stable.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="50.0">But suddenly the pacemaker stopped working</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="53.0">And they think I compromised it somehow.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="56.0">Believe me, I didn't, Nova just needed a scapegoat.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="59.0">I might know how we can figure out who did, though.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="64.0">!ATTACHMENT:link#%#Universal Medical#%#208.93.170.15</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="67.0">We should be able to find the director's medical information here.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="70.0">For the sake of not alerting Nova, I think it best to avoid using the Case File and Forensic Analyzer.</AddIRCMessage>
<AddIRCMessage Author="G" TargetComp="finaleIRC" Delay="73.0">Anyways, let's solve this case.</AddIRCMessage>
