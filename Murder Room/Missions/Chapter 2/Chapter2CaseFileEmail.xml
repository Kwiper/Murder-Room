<body>Ingrid Miles was involved in a case file the victim was investigating?
That's incredibly suspicious. Well done on finding this so quickly. If we can just link her to the time of the murder, we've got her dead to rights.
By the way, I have just uploaded another program for you to use. You might be able to access things you weren't able to before now.
