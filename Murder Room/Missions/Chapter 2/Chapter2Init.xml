<body>Hello, agent.
It's another beautiful day. Unfortunately for us, that also means it's another day to solve a murder.
This case is a bit more straightforward. Lucky for us, not straightforward enough for the regular authorities to solve.

The murder occured on February 6th, 2020. The body of Kara Oliver was found bleeding out on her kitchen floor by her wife, Annette Coleman.
The time of death was determined to be around 11:40 PM. The wife was supposedly in the shower when the murder happened, however there were no
signs of a break-in. Foul play is suspected, but authorities were unable to surmise by whom.

The victim happened to be an officer on the NYPD. It might be a good idea to look there.

Oh, and one more thing. I've uploaded a new tool to your computer. It should be useful for finding mobile devices. You might have spotted it in the previous case.

As always, I'll be here to help you.
