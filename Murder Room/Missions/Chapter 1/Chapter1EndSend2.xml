<subject>Case File: HS-4 - Termination</subject>
<body>So Mashun hacked into Staleski's computer to steal $10,000 from his bank account?

Wow, talk about a motive. I wonder how he found out about the money transfer? Did somebody tip him off?
In any case, this is definitely all the proof we need to arrest Mashun. Great job tackling this case, agent.
This couldn't have been solved without your help. Actually it could have, another agent would have been assigned to this case.

Say the word whenever you're ready to convict.
