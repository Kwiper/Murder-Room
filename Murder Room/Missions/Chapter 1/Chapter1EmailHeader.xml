<body>This is the victim's work email, huh?
Doesn't seem like it connects to the rest of the DLabs network. Not that I think you'll need to.
But you might be able to find a connection from another node here. Remember how you uploaded Staleski's email address and it revealed the email node IP?
Well, the Forensic Analyzer can take things a step above that and analyze email headers and reveal the source IPs of emails. This is apparently useful for finding nodes outside of a certain network. Give it a go, see what you can dig up.
