<body>Good job, agent. This might be everything we need.

Whenever you're ready, I can give the go ahead and call for the arrest of David Mashun.
If you feel there's still more to uncover, you can keep looking. Honestly, the more you
can dig up, the better.

Say the word, and I'll send the order.
