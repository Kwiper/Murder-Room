<body>Good day, agent.
This case is a bit of a mystery, since it's hard to pinpoint a timeline of events. I'll just cut to the chase.

On January 14, 2020, the body of Martin Staleski was discovered in his apartment. Forensic evidence could not determine a definite time of death, making it harder to determine a timeframe and compare alibis.
Needless to say, this ended up becoming a cold case pretty quickly. 

The first thing we should do is try to establish a concrete time of death before we proceed. Take a look through the Case File and see what you can dig up.
