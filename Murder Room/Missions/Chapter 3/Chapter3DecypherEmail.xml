<subject>Pills Receipt</subject>
<body>What...?
If Sterling purchased the bottle of pills, then that means...
No, we still can't be sure yet. There must be something we're missing. Perhaps someone slipped the poison in when he wasn't looking?

Perhaps his final message will finally shed some light on this situation. After contacting some sources, I have finally uncovered a way for us to decrypt the message.
It has been uploaded to your computer. Run it on the encrypted file, and let us discover the truth of this case once and for all, operative.
