<subject>The Truth Revealed</subject>
<body>So, at last the truth of our organization has been revealed.
However, this is merely one truth of a greater whole. You see, while G managed to lead you on this wild goose chase to discover the truth about Nova, he conveniently forgot one crucial thing:

Who is Mahler?

I could give you the answer, however I feel as if your trust in me and Nova as a whole has been somewhat compromised with these recent events.
Therefore, I present to you your final case: Who killed George Yularen?
Your final piece of evidence has been uploaded to the Case File.
