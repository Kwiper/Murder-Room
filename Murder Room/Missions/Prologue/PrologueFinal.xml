<body>Nice job, you should be familiar with the system now. Though if you still need help, I have attached a guide for all Nova operatives for you to view.

Your future cases are gonna be much longer and more complicated than this one, this was just to show you the ropes to get you ready for the real stuff. I won't tell you how to do the rest of your job since... well, thatâ€™s why we hired you. Reply when you're ready to get started for real.

I look forward to working with you, agent. Good luck, and welcome to the murder room. 
-G
