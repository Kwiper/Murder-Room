<body>I... what. I hope you're joking, the culprit could not have been more obvious.
In any case, you should be familiar with how the system works by now. If you still need help, I have attached a guide to the system for all Nova operatives. I won't tell you how to do the rest of your job since... well, that's why we hired you. Reply when you're ready to get started for real.

I look forward to working with you, agent. Good luck, and welcome to the murder room.
