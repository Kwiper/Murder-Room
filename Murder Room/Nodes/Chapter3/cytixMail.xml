Do you still have contacts to that source for the Byrons fraud article? Ben's asked me to publish an update on that story.

<email recipient="NoahSterling" sender="Ben Smith" subject="Weekly Meeting Update">Hey all,
Just letting you know about the weekly meeting on Saturday. Please remember to bring updates to the stories you're working on.

Thanks,

<email recipient="NoahSterling" sender="Ismail Ahmad" subject="Lunch">Yo Noah, we still on for lunch today?
I realize I probably could've texted this to you but my phone was too far away. Anyways, let me know, email or text.</email>
<email recipient="NoahSterling" sender="Mahler" subject="Important Source">Dear Sterling,

I have received important information from that source I was talking about earlier. It's all attached in this email.

Dear all,

I know we are all deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of Noah. He was a truly hard worker, an excellent journalist, and above all, a real friend to us all.
Ismail has been kind enough to host a memorial service for him after work on Saturday. Please do not feel obligated to attend, I realize everyone may process his passing
in different ways. However, if you would like to honor his memory, perhaps say some final words, please come to the service.

Sincerely,
Ben Smith
