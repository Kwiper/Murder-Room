<email recipient="mstaleski" sender="Derek Reynolds" subject="Re: Inactivity Notice">Hey Martin,
Just emailing you checking in. Haven't heard from you in days, you doing alright?
I know I sent David over to give you some files but he said you weren't there and just dropped them in your mail.

Please respond,
Derek Reynolds</email>
<email recipient="mstaleski" sender="Derek Reynolds" subject="Re: Re: Inactivity Notice">Hey Martin,
Still haven't heard from you. We're all getting worried here. David hasn't said a thing. Lisa also called your girlfriend, she has no idea either.
I also hate to be "that guy" but you're gonna need to come back soon or I'll have no choice but to fire you, bud.
