  To reference original songs, use their name in the files! You don't need the path, just the filename. This works for any songs in these folders:

  Content/DLC/Music
  
  To Play your own songs, use the path to that song in your extension.
  For example, try changing the song name below to "Music/Chemical_Burns.ogg" - it'll start with that instead for new saves! -->

DISCLAIMER: This extension features descriptions of deadly crimes and depictions of bloodied murder weapons. 
While the extension doesn't go so far as to show any actual violence, nor any gratuitous gore, some player discretion is still advised.
This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the author's imagination or used in a fictitious manner. 
Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.</WorkshopDescription>

  <!-- Path to the preview image used on the steam workshop for your extension.
  This must be within your mod folder, be 16x9 aspect ratio and less than 1MB in size. 
  I recommend the highest resolution you can provide that fits that criteria, 
  though steam will likely use a version less than 512x512 in size, and will auto resize it for you.
  
  This can be different to the provided Logo.png if you want, as this will not be transparently backed on steam.
  Supported formats are .png, .jpg and .gif

  <!-- This is the workshop publish ID. The first time your extension is published to Steam, this will be automatically populated with the ID that steam assigns it.
  When this happens, make sure that you keep that version of the file and store the ID somewhere - without it, you wont be able to push out updates to your extension,
  and if it's removed, publishing to the workshop will submit it as a new entry, and you'll lose all of your subscribers. Be careful!
  Do not manually modify this unless you already know your Publish ID from a previous submission. A new ID will only be generated if this says "NONE"-->
